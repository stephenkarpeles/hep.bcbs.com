    "article": "For every mother who dies a pregnancy-related death in the U.S., 70 experience a life threatening event. These are unexpected cases of what doctors call severe maternal morbidity (SMM), such as cardiac arrest, hemorrhage or sepsis, events that could be fatal or affect a woman long after childbirth. The overall rate of these events has increased by over 200% in the past two decades. And the statistics are worse for women of color. Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago found that Black women face a 70% higher risk of SMM than any other racial group. Doulas might provide the prenatal support women at risk need to have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth. The role of doulas in reducing SMM Doulas provide emotional, physical, and informational support to women before, during and after childbirth. They’re trained but non-clinical partners to women, often supplementing care from doctors and midwives. There’s evidence to suggest that working with a doula can reduce serious complications. Research finds that doula care can help reduce C-sections, decrease maternal anxiety and depression and help coordinate care and communication between women of color and their other healthcare providers. According to March of Dimes, “The role of doula care in reducing C-sections is important, because C-sections contribute to the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality in initial and subsequent pregnancies.” Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are increasing support for doulas Many BCBS companies are including doula coverage in their members’ plans, making philanthropic contributions to doula organizations that focus on underserved communities and funding training programs for doulas. Training: The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation funded a program at Western Michigan University Homer Stryker Medical School to create and train a network of eight community doulas to assist women at risk of poor birth outcomes. Eliminating disparities: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota has taken action to help increase access to culturally appropriate doula services for women of color in its Medicaid plan. To make the doula model more sustainable, the company increased reimbursement rates by 60% for contracted providers for non-labor and delivery visits. It is also providing workforce development scholarships to increase the number of doulas in areas with the least access and providing member education about the doula program. Doula coverage: CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, through their grant making efforts, covers doula services for Medicaid patients, including for those who visit the innovative Mamatoto Village, an organization focused on empowering Black mothers with services and education. Supporting doula organizations: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois has provided funding to Chicago Volunteer Doulas, who care for pregnant and new mothers in vulnerable communities. Excellus BlueCross BlueShield supports Syracuse Community Connections, an organization that provides culturally competent doula care with a focus on Black women and women of color. Doulas and culturally competent care Doulas may also be able to play another role in eliminating racial disparities in maternal health. A Tufts University School of Medicine researcher notes that doulas may be more trusted members of the community and able to spend time listening to a mother's needs and concerns. Within the traditional healthcare system, Black women face unconscious bias, which can cause doctors to dismiss a Black mother's concerns or create a lack of trust between patient and doctor.

    "teaser": "On a mission to ensure Black mothers receive the care they need for postpartum depression and other mood disorders, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey is breaking down barriers to access and learning more about a disparity in diagnosis rates.",
    "article": "About one in nine mothers experiences postpartum depression or another mood disorder in the U.S., a condition that can be crippling for a new mother and affect a newborn’s development. For Black mothers, rates of postpartum depression may be even higher, but many are never diagnosed. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey (Horizon) experts believe that highlights another racial disparity in the way Black mothers receive care, disparities that have led to this alarming statistic: New Jersey has the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation (among states that report this data). So the health plan is on a mission to make sure Black mothers and babies thrive. It’s just one part of Horizon’s pledge to eliminate health disparities. Identifying the root causes and the smartest interventions The key is a unique partnership between the state’s Medicaid agency, Horizon, which manages more than a million Medicaid members and the state’s largest health system, RWJBarnabas Health. University of Chicago researchers are guiding the team’s work, using evidence based strategies. Together, they’ve been digging into the root causes behind disparities in postpartum depression or other mood disorder diagnosis rates and mapping out the best ways to intervene. Why Black women may not be getting equitably diagnosed or treated Many doctors use a standard method for screening postpartum depression. But Horizon’s Valerie Harr says that method may fall short for Black mothers “Postpartum depression may not be expressed the same way by Black women,” says Harr. “They may experience physical symptoms. They may experience stigma in their own communities when it comes to depression,” which means they may not be as comfortable reaching out for help. Harr says the team’s analysis also found that Black mothers may not be able to access postpartum care as easily as their White counterparts. They may need transportation, childcare or help paying out of pocket costs for appointments. Medicaid patients face the biggest barriers to care. In addition, there may be stigma associated with seeking behavioral healthcare. Designing a new approach to helping Black mothers receive postpartum care Harr says Horizon will pilot some solutions with Medicaid patients in Newark, N.J., an area with some of the most tragic outcomes for Black mothers and babies. In the near future, Harr says Horizon can: Tap into the expertise of community health workers and doulas to address the social determinants of health that affect participants Provide culturally sensitive health education for participants and healthcare providers Help raise awareness among clinicians about how to find and make effective referrals for postpartum behavioral health treatment The health plan and its partners will also be piloting programs to: Educate clinicians about culturally appropriate ways to diagnose postpartum mood disorders Encourage providers to reach out proactively to Black mothers for follow up visits Help providers make treatment referrals Tap into a network of trusted community health workers who can help moms get to follow up appointments Empower doulas, women trained to support and educate moms through and after childbirth, to connect women with postpartum care Harr says that while the initiative continues to evolve, the team is committed to making New Jersey a model for improving maternal health.

Contributing to that alarming death rate are tragically high rates of substance use disorders (SUDs). To address these disparities, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona is helping pregnant and parenting women access education, care and treatment for SUDs in tribal communities across the state.",
    "article": "Arizona has the third-highest American Indian population in the U.S., comprised of Apache, Hopi, Navajo and many other tribes. One of the most significant health crises facing these communities is substance use disorder (SUD). Rates of SUDs are higher among American Indians than any other population group in the country, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A complex fabric of social and historical factors make American Indian populations more vulnerable to substance use and inhibit their access to treatment: Historical trauma Racism and discrimination High levels of poverty High unemployment rates Underfunded health services Shortages of providers in rural communities Lack of transportation These same factors contribute to devastating maternal death rates. In Arizona, American Indian women face rates as high 70.8 deaths per 100,000 births according to the CDC. The average maternal death rate across the U.S. is 16.7 per 100,000. Tribal communities throughout Arizona have identified the need for more education, prevention and treatment to serve pregnant and parenting women with a SUD. Mobilize AZ Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona (BCBSAZ) is the state's largest health insurer. Partnering with Arizona's tribal nations, the company is committed to supporting native mothers and newborns through culturally appropriate interventions. In part, that means investing in programs and organizations that already serve American Indian communities throughout the state and expanding their capacity. The health insurer's public health initiative, Mobilize AZ, focuses on key health issues impacting Arizonans - substance use disorder, mental health, and diabetes, as well as social determinants of health.  The initiative earmarks millions of dollars each year to build statewide capacity and resources for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, resiliency, and recovery efforts. Funding priority is given to projects that expand resources, increase systems-level capacity, target an identified vulnerable population, and have a measurable impact. Through this initiative, BCBSAZ is supporting: Free childcare for native women receiving SUD treatment Culturally appropriate education on substance use prevention for young women and providers in tribal communities Programs that build self-esteem among American Indian girls and young mothers.

    "teaser": "Too many Americans, including pregnant women, aren’t sure where their next meal is coming from or whether they’ll have enough food to go around for the whole family. But some communities are stepping up ways to connect pregnant women with the food and nutritional education they need to stay healthy.",
    "article": "Researchers are still learning how limited or uncertain access to nutritious food can be harmful during and after pregnancy for both mother and baby. Food insecurity may increase the release of stress hormones, which has been linked to pre-term birth as well asunhealthy changes in a mother’s pregnancy weight. It has been linked to an increased risk for post-partum depression. Food insecurity can also affect a pregnant woman’s blood pressure, and so much more. Who is food insecure? The burden of food insecurity is borne disproportionately by Black, Indigenous and women of color. Federal statistics show Black Americans are twice as likely to be food insecure as the national average. Through another lens, one in five Black people is food insecure, according to Feeding America. Federal food assistance programs may help. But doctors and health insurers are seeing an opportunity — and using new resources — to support women at risk. Three programs that keep pregnant women and their families from going hungry In Minnesota, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is studying the impact of providing mothers and families in need clinically tailored meals, food boxes and nutritional coaching. Members can start as early as 20 weeks into their pregnancy and continue through the second month after birth. The healthy food program is a partnership with Project Well and Second Harvest Heartland, which will deliver the food and the coaching. Members can also be connected to additional food benefit programs and resources to meet other social needs through case management. In New York, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield is working with FoodLink, a local food bank, to pilot a nutrition program designed to identify at - risk moms and connect them to nutritional education and resources. Experts from Excellus BCBS say providing boxes of food is only one step in addressing food insecurity. Empowering mothers with culturally competent nutrition education can do even more to keep moms and their children healthy. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City works with local food banks and food distributions centers to help members who are pregnant or new moms. Mothers who continue to experience food insecurity are connected with a state food assistance program. The health plan trains front line providers to screen women for food insecurity. Then Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City community health workers connect those members to resources to meet their social needs and follow up with providers. Food as healthcare Healthcare providers and health insurers are increasingly involved in meeting more than just medical needs for their patients. They recognize that having enough food to eat, or access to transportation, among other social needs, are just as critical for good health as a blood test or a sonogram. And right now, there may be more needs to meet. The economic crisis brought on by the pandemic has left more Americans out of work, living in poverty and struggling. Programs like these will be critical for catching those who might otherwise fall through the cracks.

    "article": "BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and the BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina Foundation launched Diabetes Free SC, a multi-million dollar, statewide initiative dedicated to addressing disparities in care in several strategic areas including improved pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes.  BCBSSC is joining with several organizations well-established in the trenches of diabetes care.  According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), more than 500,000 adults in the state have diagnosed diabetes while an additional 120,000 are unaware that they have the disease. African-Americans have a two times higher death rate from the disease than white adults. According to David Pankau, president and CEO of BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, this effort reflects the organization’s commitment to improving the health of South Carolina communities. He said, “We believe that we can play a meaningful role in reducing disparities of care. Our vision for making a difference in this space has been under discussion for a long time. There is even more urgency now as diabetes brings additional risk in the midst of skyrocketing COVID-19 rates. As we build upon the good work already being done, we are putting a stake in the ground with our commitment.”  Additional facts: 26,000 people in South Carolina will be diagnosed this year with diabetes. Nearly 35% of the state’s adult population has prediabetes. In addition to pregnancy, diabetes is also a significant factor in other conditions including kidney and cardiovascular disease, which disproportionately affects African-Americans. Goals of the program also include reduced lifelong risk of diabetes in children; and the prevention of diabetes and its complications in adults. The annual cost of care for adult South Carolinians with diagnosed diabetes is estimated at $5.89 billion (2017) BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, an association of independent, locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies.",

Better Beginnings boasts a 70% engagement rate among BCBS VT’s expectant members. Participants benefit from wraparound support both before and after delivery. Enrollment begins with a comprehensive health risk assessment that includes mental and behavioral health factors, medical considerations, social needs and language, cultural and religious preferences. From there, members are paired with a nurse case manager who can support their unique needs through pregnancy and beyond. Postpartum, new mothers are screened for depression and have access to in-network lactation consultants.

At Spira Care Centers the member experience is simple and personal, while also innovative and forward-thinking. Members have access to integrated primary care, behavioral health consultations, health coaching, routine lab draws and more all in one place at low or no cost. Additionally, through successful community intervention, Blue KC aims to reduce disparities in prenatal care, by offering guidance and support to raise the awareness among mothers about potential health risks. The CHW strategy will include breast feeding support, lactation consultation and prenatal and postnatal education and support. Engagement with members will start prenatal and continue to one-year postpartum. Blue KC is also exploring innovative ways to engage CHWs in other community settings to further meet individuals where they are. For example, they could expand into schools and public libraries. This work is to level the playing field and remove barriers that cause unequal access to care and to health outcomes, and make sure education and access is offered in a way community members understand.

Doulas are nonmedical professionals who provide physical, emotional and educational support to mothers before, during and after birth. Excellus BCBS and Syracuse Community Connections are bringing this one-on-one care to new and expectant mothers in Upstate New York. The program brings culturally competent mentorship to women in underserved Black and Brown communities who may need further support than they receive in the hospital setting. Beyond traditional support, participating doulas also help mothers access the care they need, provide breastfeeding coaching and screen for postpartum depression. The health insurer has also partnered with Foodlink to pilot a nutrition program for pregnant women with high-risk needs and significant food insecurity. Sound nutritional health is critical for the health of mothers and babies. To make sure expectant mothers do not lose access to this resource through the COVID-19 pandemic, Excellus BCBS helped adapt this program to a food delivery service. For women with substance use disorder (SUD), Excellus BCBS has adapted its traditional maternal care program for specialized support. The Enhanced Bright Beginnings program helps pregnant women in any stage of addiction--whether they are actively using or substance-free. The goal: to help expectant and new mothers avoid substance use and relapse both during and after pregnancy. Each woman is paired with two care managers: a registered nurse and a certified alcohol and substance abuse counselor (CASAC) specializing in addiction support.

Recognizing that the health needs of economically distressed neighborhoods cannot only be met through the doctor's office, Independence BC joined forces with Project HOME and AmeriHealth Caritas to address significant health disparities experienced in North Philadelphia. The area's predominantly Black and Hispanic residents face lower life expectancies and higher rates of infant mortality than their counterparts elsewhere the city. To connect these residents to social resources and improve maternal and family health outcomes, the organizations created the Keystone Connection to Wellness initiative. To better understand how social determinants of health impact high-risk maternity patients, Independence BC is also building predictive models into its existing maternal care program: Baby Blueprints. Available to all expectant members, the program supports women before, during and after birth. This work includes behavioral health screenings and social need assessments for factors including transportation, food security and financial wellbeing. By incorporating predictive capabilities into this program, Independence BC hopes to better understand and support the complex needs of high-risk mothers. The health insurer is also participating in and helping fund a novel study on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on pre-term birth outcomes. The study is led by Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Nemours Children's Hospital and will use member data from Independence BC, Highmark Blue Shield of Delaware, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania Health System.

In addition to referrals from individual physicians, BCBSLA receives referrals to Healthy Blue Beginnings from its relationship with Louisiana Women’s Healthcare Associates (LWHA), the largest OB/GYN physician group in the state of Louisiana. Obstetricians at LWHA refer patients to Healthy Blue Beginnings if they have one or more of a list of conditions that includes: History of preterm labor Diabetes Hypertension Obesity History of smoking Substance use disorder In the 2020s, data is now an important healthcare partner, and data plays a part with high-risk pregnancy referrals, too. Recently, Blue Cross began receiving Admit, Discharge, Transfer (ADT) data from any healthcare provider that uses an electronic medical records system and has a capability to feed the insurer their data. Another pregnancy support program is a unique texting service called text4baby. Whether or not a woman joins Healthy Blue Beginnings, BCBSLA encourages her to join text4baby. Moms get free text messages with health and safety tips for their pregnancy and baby’s first year. The messages are tailored based on due date or baby’s birth date. Just text the word BABY (BEBE for Spanish tips) to 511411 on your cellphone.  Stronger Than is a BCBSLA care management program that can connect women to these services listed above as well as a wide range of free or low-cost community services. One of these is Coffective, a coalition of community resources to support women before, during and after pregnancy. Find more at supportservices.bcbsla.com. Blue Cross employees and the Blue Cross Foundation also support the health of babies and young children in a number of ways. The Foundation’s focus is on Louisiana children’s health and wellbeing, and many of its grants are awarded accordingly. One the Foundation’s most successful grantees, Fit NOLA, has recently expanded a program that lets doctors give “fruit and vegetable prescriptions” to pregnant women, people with diabetes and others, redeemable for free at local farmers’ markets.

The goal is to unite private and public organizations to lower preterm birth, the leading cause of infant death in the state, through pledges from hospitals to end non-medically indicated elective inductions, public and private alignment on a non-payment policy and outreach to at-risk mothers. Launched in 2011, the BOI has three interconnected goals that work together to improve birth outcomes throughout the state, including: Reducing the number of low birth weight babies Reducing NICU admissions and stays Reducing racial disparities in birth outcomes The overarching goal of the South Carolina BOI is to end elective inductions for non-medically indicated deliveries prior to 39 weeks and make resources available to at-risk mothers. The State of South Carolina used its multi-stakeholder BOI to reduce early-term, elective inductions by 50 percent, improving birth outcomes while saving the state and the federal government $6 million in Medicaid spending for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. How it works:  Partnered with leaders from key clinical organizations and gained agreement from all birthing hospitals to stop early elective deliveries. - Implemented a policy of non-payment for early elective deliveries without medical necessity, a private and public (Medicaid) solution. - Leveraged member maternity programs and the Centering Pregnancy model of care. The BOI contains a number of components, including a policy adopted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and BCBSSC, South Carolinas largest commercial insurer, to stop paying for early elective deliveries (elective inductions and cesarean deliveries prior to 39 weeks gestation. South Carolina was the first state in the nation where both public (Medicaid) and private (BCBSSC) entities implemented the same non-payment policy for early elective deliveries for both hospitals and physicians.

    "article": "Your health shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the neighborhood you live in, but too often it does. Communities of color, accounting for nearly 40% of the U.S. population, bear a disproportionate burden of preventable disease, disability and death. Today, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association launched a National Health Equity Strategy to reimagine a more equitable system of health. This is a multiyear effort to address the nation’s unconscionable and unacceptable racial health disparities that have afflicted generations of Americans. This strategy builds on the pledge all Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) companies made last year to lead the essential work to fight systemic racism. Your health shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the neighborhood you live in. Health disparities are the result of a complex fabric of social, racial and economic injustice—a fabric we can’t unravel overnight. But starting here and now, the Blues are taking immediate and ongoing action to put an end to these inequities, setting bold goals and holding ourselves accountable to tangible results.A Crisis in Maternal Health Our first focus:in the next five years, we will reduce racial disparities in maternal health by 50%. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that women of color—specifically Black and Indigenous women—are three times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than their white counterparts. In fact, the U.S. is the most dangerous developed country to have a baby. This is a crisis we must confront. Many BCBS companies have started this work and are already focused on preventing these dangerous outcomes. Their work to date includes: Identifying women at risk and providing one-on-one coaching to manage their chronic conditions during pregnancy. Offering “prescriptions” for healthy food delivery and nutrition counseling—addressing underlying social determinants that have a significant impact on health. Providing doula support to mothers throughout their pre- and postnatal journeys. We will continue taking proven initiatives—and finding the best new ideas—and making them available to more people and communities across the country. An Invitation to Join Us To address racial health disparities in a meaningful way, we must bring more people to the table to create lasting change. That’s why we have convened a national advisory panel of distinguished doctors, public health experts and community leaders to guide this work. With their counsel, we’ll be focusing on specific efforts to build a more equitable future: Encouraging industry initiatives to develop national standards for the collection of race, ethnicity and language (R/E/L) data, to understand where we are today and track our progress. Partnering with providers to offer unconscious bias training and incentives to ensure culturally appropriate care and improve health outcomes. Leaning into new and longstanding relationships with community organizations to address root causes of inequities. Advocating for public policies at the state and federal levels to improve access to health coverage and supporting efforts like the CDC’s recently announced initiatives to address racism as a public health threat, the White House’s first-ever proclamation on Black maternal health and the Momnibus package. These are just some of the steps the Blues are committed to, and we invite others—industry leaders, policymakers, providers, employers and other stakeholders—to join us in this crucial work. Together, I believe we can build a new model of equitable care. Not just for the 110 million BCBS members, but for all Americans.",
