    "article": "For every mother who dies a pregnancy-related death in the U.S., 70 experience a life threatening event. These are unexpected cases of what doctors call severe maternal morbidity (SMM), such as cardiac arrest, hemorrhage or sepsis, events that could be fatal or affect a woman long after childbirth. The overall rate of these events has increased by over 200% in the past two decades. And the statistics are worse for women of color. Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago found that Black women face a 70% higher risk of SMM than any other racial group. Doulas might provide the prenatal support women at risk need to have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth. The role of doulas in reducing SMM Doulas provide emotional, physical, and informational support to women before, during and after childbirth. They’re trained but non-clinical partners to women, often supplementing care from doctors and midwives. There’s evidence to suggest that working with a doula can reduce serious complications. Research finds that doula care can help reduce C-sections, decrease maternal anxiety and depression and help coordinate care and communication between women of color and their other healthcare providers. According to March of Dimes, “The role of doula care in reducing C-sections is important, because C-sections contribute to the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality in initial and subsequent pregnancies.” Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are increasing support for doulas Many BCBS companies are including doula coverage in their members’ plans, making philanthropic contributions to doula organizations that focus on underserved communities and funding training programs for doulas. Training: The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation funded a program at Western Michigan University Homer Stryker Medical School to create and train a network of eight community doulas to assist women at risk of poor birth outcomes. Eliminating disparities: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota has taken action to help increase access to culturally appropriate doula services for women of color in its Medicaid plan. To make the doula model more sustainable, the company increased reimbursement rates by 60% for contracted providers for non-labor and delivery visits. It is also providing workforce development scholarships to increase the number of doulas in areas with the least access and providing member education about the doula program. Doula coverage: CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, through their grant making efforts, covers doula services for Medicaid patients, including for those who visit the innovative Mamatoto Village, an organization focused on empowering Black mothers with services and education. Supporting doula organizations: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois has provided funding to Chicago Volunteer Doulas, who care for pregnant and new mothers in vulnerable communities. Excellus BlueCross BlueShield supports Syracuse Community Connections, an organization that provides culturally competent doula care with a focus on Black women and women of color. Doulas and culturally competent care Doulas may also be able to play another role in eliminating racial disparities in maternal health. A Tufts University School of Medicine researcher notes that doulas may be more trusted members of the community and able to spend time listening to a mother's needs and concerns. Within the traditional healthcare system, Black women face unconscious bias, which can cause doctors to dismiss a Black mother's concerns or create a lack of trust between patient and doctor.

    "teaser": "On a mission to ensure Black mothers receive the care they need for postpartum depression and other mood disorders, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey is breaking down barriers to access and learning more about a disparity in diagnosis rates.",
    "article": "About one in nine mothers experiences postpartum depression or another mood disorder in the U.S., a condition that can be crippling for a new mother and affect a newborn’s development. For Black mothers, rates of postpartum depression may be even higher, but many are never diagnosed. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey (Horizon) experts believe that highlights another racial disparity in the way Black mothers receive care, disparities that have led to this alarming statistic: New Jersey has the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation (among states that report this data). So the health plan is on a mission to make sure Black mothers and babies thrive. It’s just one part of Horizon’s pledge to eliminate health disparities. Identifying the root causes and the smartest interventions The key is a unique partnership between the state’s Medicaid agency, Horizon, which manages more than a million Medicaid members and the state’s largest health system, RWJBarnabas Health. University of Chicago researchers are guiding the team’s work, using evidence based strategies. Together, they’ve been digging into the root causes behind disparities in postpartum depression or other mood disorder diagnosis rates and mapping out the best ways to intervene. Why Black women may not be getting equitably diagnosed or treated Many doctors use a standard method for screening postpartum depression. But Horizon’s Valerie Harr says that method may fall short for Black mothers “Postpartum depression may not be expressed the same way by Black women,” says Harr. “They may experience physical symptoms. They may experience stigma in their own communities when it comes to depression,” which means they may not be as comfortable reaching out for help. Harr says the team’s analysis also found that Black mothers may not be able to access postpartum care as easily as their White counterparts. They may need transportation, childcare or help paying out of pocket costs for appointments. Medicaid patients face the biggest barriers to care. In addition, there may be stigma associated with seeking behavioral healthcare. Designing a new approach to helping Black mothers receive postpartum care Harr says Horizon will pilot some solutions with Medicaid patients in Newark, N.J., an area with some of the most tragic outcomes for Black mothers and babies. In the near future, Harr says Horizon can: Tap into the expertise of community health workers and doulas to address the social determinants of health that affect participants Provide culturally sensitive health education for participants and healthcare providers Help raise awareness among clinicians about how to find and make effective referrals for postpartum behavioral health treatment The health plan and its partners will also be piloting programs to: Educate clinicians about culturally appropriate ways to diagnose postpartum mood disorders Encourage providers to reach out proactively to Black mothers for follow up visits Help providers make treatment referrals Tap into a network of trusted community health workers who can help moms get to follow up appointments Empower doulas, women trained to support and educate moms through and after childbirth, to connect women with postpartum care Harr says that while the initiative continues to evolve, the team is committed to making New Jersey a model for improving maternal health.

Contributing to that alarming death rate are tragically high rates of substance use disorders (SUDs). To address these disparities, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona is helping pregnant and parenting women access education, care and treatment for SUDs in tribal communities across the state.",
    "article": "Arizona has the third-highest American Indian population in the U.S., comprised of Apache, Hopi, Navajo and many other tribes. One of the most significant health crises facing these communities is substance use disorder (SUD). Rates of SUDs are higher among American Indians than any other population group in the country, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A complex fabric of social and historical factors make American Indian populations more vulnerable to substance use and inhibit their access to treatment: Historical trauma Racism and discrimination High levels of poverty High unemployment rates Underfunded health services Shortages of providers in rural communities Lack of transportation These same factors contribute to devastating maternal death rates. In Arizona, American Indian women face rates as high 70.8 deaths per 100,000 births according to the CDC. The average maternal death rate across the U.S. is 16.7 per 100,000. Tribal communities throughout Arizona have identified the need for more education, prevention and treatment to serve pregnant and parenting women with a SUD. Mobilize AZ Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona (BCBSAZ) is the state's largest health insurer. Partnering with Arizona's tribal nations, the company is committed to supporting native mothers and newborns through culturally appropriate interventions. In part, that means investing in programs and organizations that already serve American Indian communities throughout the state and expanding their capacity. The health insurer's public health initiative, Mobilize AZ, focuses on key health issues impacting Arizonans - substance use disorder, mental health, and diabetes, as well as social determinants of health.  The initiative earmarks millions of dollars each year to build statewide capacity and resources for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, resiliency, and recovery efforts. Funding priority is given to projects that expand resources, increase systems-level capacity, target an identified vulnerable population, and have a measurable impact. Through this initiative, BCBSAZ is supporting: Free childcare for native women receiving SUD treatment Culturally appropriate education on substance use prevention for young women and providers in tribal communities Programs that build self-esteem among American Indian girls and young mothers.

    "teaser": "Too many Americans, including pregnant women, aren’t sure where their next meal is coming from or whether they’ll have enough food to go around for the whole family. But some communities are stepping up ways to connect pregnant women with the food and nutritional education they need to stay healthy.",
    "article": "Researchers are still learning how limited or uncertain access to nutritious food can be harmful during and after pregnancy for both mother and baby. Food insecurity may increase the release of stress hormones, which has been linked to pre-term birth as well asunhealthy changes in a mother’s pregnancy weight. It has been linked to an increased risk for post-partum depression. Food insecurity can also affect a pregnant woman’s blood pressure, and so much more. Who is food insecure? The burden of food insecurity is borne disproportionately by Black, Indigenous and women of color. Federal statistics show Black Americans are twice as likely to be food insecure as the national average. Through another lens, one in five Black people is food insecure, according to Feeding America. Federal food assistance programs may help. But doctors and health insurers are seeing an opportunity — and using new resources — to support women at risk. Three programs that keep pregnant women and their families from going hungry In Minnesota, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota is studying the impact of providing mothers and families in need clinically tailored meals, food boxes and nutritional coaching. Members can start as early as 20 weeks into their pregnancy and continue through the second month after birth. The healthy food program is a partnership with Project Well and Second Harvest Heartland, which will deliver the food and the coaching. Members can also be connected to additional food benefit programs and resources to meet other social needs through case management. In New York, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield is working with FoodLink, a local food bank, to pilot a nutrition program designed to identify at - risk moms and connect them to nutritional education and resources. Experts from Excellus BCBS say providing boxes of food is only one step in addressing food insecurity. Empowering mothers with culturally competent nutrition education can do even more to keep moms and their children healthy. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City works with local food banks and food distributions centers to help members who are pregnant or new moms. Mothers who continue to experience food insecurity are connected with a state food assistance program. The health plan trains front line providers to screen women for food insecurity. Then Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City community health workers connect those members to resources to meet their social needs and follow up with providers. Food as healthcare Healthcare providers and health insurers are increasingly involved in meeting more than just medical needs for their patients. They recognize that having enough food to eat, or access to transportation, among other social needs, are just as critical for good health as a blood test or a sonogram. And right now, there may be more needs to meet. The economic crisis brought on by the pandemic has left more Americans out of work, living in poverty and struggling. Programs like these will be critical for catching those who might otherwise fall through the cracks.

    "article": "BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and the BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina Foundation launched Diabetes Free SC, a multi-million dollar, statewide initiative dedicated to addressing disparities in care in several strategic areas including improved pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes.  BCBSSC is joining with several organizations well-established in the trenches of diabetes care.  According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), more than 500,000 adults in the state have diagnosed diabetes while an additional 120,000 are unaware that they have the disease. African-Americans have a two times higher death rate from the disease than white adults. According to David Pankau, president and CEO of BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, this effort reflects the organization’s commitment to improving the health of South Carolina communities. He said, “We believe that we can play a meaningful role in reducing disparities of care. Our vision for making a difference in this space has been under discussion for a long time. There is even more urgency now as diabetes brings additional risk in the midst of skyrocketing COVID-19 rates. As we build upon the good work already being done, we are putting a stake in the ground with our commitment.”  Additional facts: 26,000 people in South Carolina will be diagnosed this year with diabetes. Nearly 35% of the state’s adult population has prediabetes. In addition to pregnancy, diabetes is also a significant factor in other conditions including kidney and cardiovascular disease, which disproportionately affects African-Americans. Goals of the program also include reduced lifelong risk of diabetes in children; and the prevention of diabetes and its complications in adults. The annual cost of care for adult South Carolinians with diagnosed diabetes is estimated at $5.89 billion (2017) BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, an association of independent, locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies.",

At Spira Care Centers the member experience is simple and personal, while also innovative and forward-thinking. Members have access to integrated primary care, behavioral health consultations, health coaching, routine lab draws and more all in one place at low or no cost. Additionally, through successful community intervention, Blue KC aims to reduce disparities in prenatal care, by offering guidance and support to raise the awareness among mothers about potential health risks. The CHW strategy will include breast feeding support, lactation consultation and prenatal and postnatal education and support. Engagement with members will start prenatal and continue to one-year postpartum. Blue KC is also exploring innovative ways to engage CHWs in other community settings to further meet individuals where they are. For example, they could expand into schools and public libraries.

Doulas are nonmedical professionals who provide physical, emotional and educational support to mothers before, during and after birth. Excellus BCBS and Syracuse Community Connections are bringing this one-on-one care to new and expectant mothers in Upstate New York. The program brings culturally competent mentorship to women in underserved Black and Brown communities who may need further support than they receive in the hospital setting. Beyond traditional support, participating doulas also help mothers access the care they need, provide breastfeeding coaching and screen for postpartum depression. The health insurer has also partnered with Foodlink to pilot a nutrition program for pregnant women with high-risk needs and significant food insecurity. Sound nutritional health is critical for the health of mothers and babies. To make sure expectant mothers do not lose access to this resource through the COVID-19 pandemic, Excellus BCBS helped adapt this program to a food delivery service. For women with substance use disorder (SUD), Excellus BCBS has adapted its traditional maternal care program for specialized support. The Enhanced Bright Beginnings program helps pregnant women in any stage of addiction--whether they are actively using or substance-free. The goal: to help expectant and new mothers avoid substance use and relapse both during and after pregnancy.

Recognizing that the health needs of economically distressed neighborhoods cannot only be met through the doctor's office, Independence BC joined forces with Project HOME and AmeriHealth Caritas to address significant health disparities experienced in North Philadelphia. The area's predominantly Black and Hispanic residents face lower life expectancies and higher rates of infant mortality than their counterparts elsewhere the city. To connect these residents to social resources and improve maternal and family health outcomes, the organizations created the Keystone Connection to Wellness initiative. To better understand how social determinants of health impact high-risk maternity patients, Independence BC is also building predictive models into its existing maternal care program: Baby Blueprints. Available to all expectant members, the program supports women before, during and after birth. This work includes behavioral health screenings and social need assessments for factors including transportation, food security and financial wellbeing. By incorporating predictive capabilities into this program, Independence BC hopes to better understand and support the complex needs of high-risk mothers. The health insurer is also participating in and helping fund a novel study on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on pre-term birth outcomes. The study is led by Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Nemours Children's Hospital and will use member data from Independence BC, Highmark Blue Shield of Delaware, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania Health System.

Another pregnancy support program is a unique texting service called text4baby. Whether or not a woman joins Healthy Blue Beginnings, BCBSLA encourages her to join text4baby. Moms get free text messages with health and safety tips for their pregnancy and baby’s first year. The messages are tailored based on due date or baby’s birth date. Just text the word BABY (BEBE for Spanish tips) to 511411 on your cellphone.  Stronger Than is a BCBSLA care management program that can connect women to these services listed above as well as a wide range of free or low-cost community services.

The goal is to unite private and public organizations to lower preterm birth, the leading cause of infant death in the state, through pledges from hospitals to end non-medically indicated elective inductions, public and private alignment on a non-payment policy and outreach to at-risk mothers. Launched in 2011, the BOI has three interconnected goals that work together to improve birth outcomes throughout the state, including: Reducing the number of low birth weight babies Reducing NICU admissions and stays Reducing racial disparities in birth outcomes The overarching goal of the South Carolina BOI is to end elective inductions for non-medically indicated deliveries prior to 39 weeks and make resources available to at-risk mothers. The State of South Carolina used its multi-stakeholder BOI to reduce early-term, elective inductions by 50 percent, improving birth outcomes while saving the state and the federal government $6 million in Medicaid spending for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. How it works:  Partnered with leaders from key clinical organizations and gained agreement from all birthing hospitals to stop early elective deliveries. - Implemented a policy of non-payment for early elective deliveries without medical necessity, a private and public (Medicaid) solution. - Leveraged member maternity programs and the Centering Pregnancy model of care. The BOI contains a number of components, including a policy adopted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and BCBSSC, South Carolinas largest commercial insurer, to stop paying for early elective deliveries (elective inductions and cesarean deliveries prior to 39 weeks gestation. South Carolina was the first state in the nation where both public (Medicaid) and private (BCBSSC) entities implemented the same non-payment policy for early elective deliveries for both hospitals and physicians.

    "article": "Your health shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the neighborhood you live in, but too often it does. Communities of color, accounting for nearly 40% of the U.S. population, bear a disproportionate burden of preventable disease, disability and death. Today, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association launched a National Health Equity Strategy to reimagine a more equitable system of health. This is a multiyear effort to address the nation’s unconscionable and unacceptable racial health disparities that have afflicted generations of Americans. This strategy builds on the pledge all Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) companies made last year to lead the essential work to fight systemic racism. Your health shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or the neighborhood you live in. Health disparities are the result of a complex fabric of social, racial and economic injustice—a fabric we can’t unravel overnight. But starting here and now, the Blues are taking immediate and ongoing action to put an end to these inequities, setting bold goals and holding ourselves accountable to tangible results.A Crisis in Maternal Health Our first focus:in the next five years, we will reduce racial disparities in maternal health by 50%. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that women of color—specifically Black and Indigenous women—are three times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than their white counterparts. In fact, the U.S. is the most dangerous developed country to have a baby. This is a crisis we must confront. Many BCBS companies have started this work and are already focused on preventing these dangerous outcomes. Their work to date includes: Identifying women at risk and providing one-on-one coaching to manage their chronic conditions during pregnancy. Offering “prescriptions” for healthy food delivery and nutrition counseling—addressing underlying social determinants that have a significant impact on health. Providing doula support to mothers throughout their pre- and postnatal journeys. We will continue taking proven initiatives—and finding the best new ideas—and making them available to more people and communities across the country. An Invitation to Join Us To address racial health disparities in a meaningful way, we must bring more people to the table to create lasting change. That’s why we have convened a national advisory panel of distinguished doctors, public health experts and community leaders to guide this work. With their counsel, we’ll be focusing on specific efforts to build a more equitable future: Encouraging industry initiatives to develop national standards for the collection of race, ethnicity and language (R/E/L) data, to understand where we are today and track our progress. Partnering with providers to offer unconscious bias training and incentives to ensure culturally appropriate care and improve health outcomes. Leaning into new and longstanding relationships with community organizations to address root causes of inequities. Advocating for public policies at the state and federal levels to improve access to health coverage and supporting efforts like the CDC’s recently announced initiatives to address racism as a public health threat, the White House’s first-ever proclamation on Black maternal health and the Momnibus package. These are just some of the steps the Blues are committed to, and we invite others—industry leaders, policymakers, providers, employers and other stakeholders—to join us in this crucial work. Together, I believe we can build a new model of equitable care. Not just for the 110 million BCBS members, but for all Americans.",

    "article": "In 10 years, Baltimore cut its infant mortality by nearly 30%. Its an incredible success story. But theres more work to do as the initiative Bmore for Healthy Babies enters its second decade. Substantial racial disparities persist between Black and white infant and maternal health. In this episode, we visit the communities hardest hit by those disparities and learn how this massive, grassroots effort is turning the tide. Infant mortality rates skyrocketing In 2009, when infant mortality rates were going down in most places, Baltimores infant mortality rate spiked to its highest ever. Nearly 14 babies were dying for every 1000 born. For white babies, the rate was 3.5 per 1000. For African American babies, 18. Black mothers were dying at higher rates, too. Maria Harris Tildon led corporate philanthropy for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which helped launch the initiative, Bmore for Healthy Babies, until 2019. Look, the notion that we are sitting in a city with major international health systems--Johns Hopkins, University of Maryland—and we are still dealing with infant mortality rates that rival third world countries is absolutely incomprehensible. When infant mortality rates were spiking in 2008, then Health Commissioner Josh Sharfstein called Harris Tildon and other health officials to a meeting to introduce them to the data and urge community, government and private partners to unite in a strategy like nothing theyd ever tried. A bold new strategy to save lives Harris Tilden says CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield provided the city with seed money for planning. The company added its own experts to the mix of community members, nonprofit agencies, and health professionals working on the problem. To start, teams combed the data about the health of moms and babies in the city, piecing together a bigger picture and teasing out the nuances of what was happening. They scoured the scientific literature for best practices in infant and maternal health. They looked for examples from other places that had managed to address this kind of major public health challenge. In a year, Baltimore had a bold, city-wide strategy involving 150 different organizations called Bmore for Healthy Babies. Part of the programs bedrock: a universal intake system for any mother and baby at risk. For Harris Tildon, its been personal. I personally am a Baltimore native. These are my neighbors. And the notion that we had the potential with a very, very thoughtful and aggressive plan to make a difference and save not only the lives of babies but really have a meaningful impact on the mothers before and after delivery was something that we thought was important and didnt hesitate to do, says Tildon. A couple of the neighborhoods in which this program is really having a significant impact are neighborhoods where I actually grew up. Those are neighborhoods steeped in poverty, stung by violence. But she says those factors alone arent responsible for Baltimores infant and maternal health crisis. Its also a history of racial inequities. For African Americans, says Harris Tildon, thats led to years of declining health. And when more than two-thirds of the citys citizens are black, she says, not taking action is like turning your back on a whole city. Home visiting to reach pregnant and postpartum women in need In Baltimores Belair-Edison neighborhood, a bit northeast of downtown, two home visitors have come to check in on a young mother named Charmaine and her baby boy Kamil. Charmaine welcomes the team into her living room just as Kamil is waking from a nap. She brings him downstairs and its clear hes thriving--eating and sleeping well and, most importantly sleeping somewhere safe. Thats one of the most important reasons these home visitors are here. With every client they visit, they repeat Bmore for Healthy Babies alphabet mantra: ABCD. Babies should always sleep: alone, on their back, in a crib or pack and play, and dont smoke. Its too dangerous to let babies sleep in a bed with others, or in a swing or a car seat, too dangerous to fill the crib with blankets and bumpers. Those increase the risk of dying from suffocation or SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome, both among the leading causes of death for babies in Baltimore. Not long before Kamil was born, Charmaine didnt have a crib. My due date was approaching and I needed help. It was like last minute and things were just not going the way that I had planned so I needed everything, says Charmaine, whose last name were not using to protect her privacy. Home visitor Bryione Moore, part of Bmore for Healthy Babies arsenal of community health workers,  brought her a pack and play and more. She brought me everything even down to one of those little sleepers for them to sleep in and stay warm. I have now a stroller, a car seat, [more] than I ever had, says Charmaine. Home visitors Bryione Moore and her partner Cheriise McNamara have a roster of pregnant and post-partum women to visit every day—women identified by that city-wide intake system. Moore and McNamara arent nurses, but theyre trained to provide resources and answer questions. They visit about 1200 women a year in neighborhoods all over Baltimore with a trunk stocked full of supplies. Moore says sometimes the needs are urgent. We try to get out there as soon as possible because we dont want people to get comfortable with putting the baby in the bed. And we have a lot of people in this like, ‘oh well I didnt have anywhere for the baby to sleep so we just thought that well put the baby in a bed, and were like ‘No! says Moore. Recently, she got a call from a woman who had already delivered her baby. She asked, So wheres the baby sleeping at the moment? And the girl said, ‘oh well the babys sleeping on a swing. And I lost my mind and I was like ‘No! Im on my way. Where do you live? Give me your address. And I went directly to her. I told her, I need to bring you this pack and play because I dont want that loss on my mind or my heart., says Moore. She didnt want the loss of a baby, because of she lacked a safe place to sleep, on her conscience.  But Moore and McNamaras visits are about more than supplies: theres a large body of evidence showing that regular home visiting programs for new mothers and babies improves the likelihood both will thrive. The practice is another part of the bedrock of the citys campaign. So at that moment when were in our homes were able to see if mom needs further assistance, says Cheriise McNamara. We try to encourage them to use home visiting as an option to carry on the care. Mothers may need food or housing assistance, follow up care for babies born premature or at a low birth weight, assistance following up with doctor visits or specialized care. A mom might be struggling with post-partum depression or substance use. Post-partum depression and things of that nature need to be assessed in order for mom to be at her best health, says McNamara. It goes hand in hand. Infant mortality and maternal mortality. If we cant keep the moms healthy, you know, they cant keep their babies healthy. An army of neighborhood moms and dads takes the message, and the resources, door to door On the other side of town from Charmaine and Kamils house, Stacey Stephens is leading a tour up a leafy street in Baltimores Upton/Druid Heights neighborhood. She runs BMore for Healthy Babies efforts in this community, which had some of the highest infant mortality rates in the city. But Stephens doesnt like to start with that fact. Shes focused on the rich history. The untapped talent. So much potential. But, says Stephens, there are areas, as we know, that have been neglected for various reasons. She points to neighborhoods like this one that have been left behind by development or politics or inequality. That process, says Stephens, sets a neighborhood up for generations of problems, including infant mortality. Thats why theres a special focus on this neighborhood, and its where Stephens comes in. Its one more part of the bedrock of the citys strategy: focus resources where communities need them most. I have a team of six who are community health workers, who we call resource parents, folks from the community who are trained in ensuring that women and families have healthy babies, says Stephens. And they do community outreach, distribute information, and look for pregnant women They go door to door, this army of resource moms and dads, knocking and asking any pregnant women here? Anyone in your family pregnant or parenting an infant? And when they do find an expecting mom, they offer to connect her and her family to any services they need as soon as possible. Thanks in part to that centralized intake system, says Stephens, Bmore for Healthy Babies has a very intricate system developed to ensure that no pregnant woman in the city falls through the cracks. So if its food they need, they can assist with that or refer them for mental health services or refer them for domestic violence services, or get them connected to insurance or health care. Stephens says they cant keep everyone from falling through the cracks. But when they can connect a woman to services, they may well be saving a babys and a mothers life. Because I know that anytime I meet a mom and shes pregnant, literally with expectations, says Stephens, this mom and dad want the absolute best for that child. Stephens says the work continues. But its critical now to sharpen the focus on maternal health in this majority black community. We know when were looking at the infant mortality rate it reflects the health of the community, says Stephens. So it already reflects the health of that woman. And so we know that when we look at our data and our numbers and the drivers of low birth weight babies, very low birth weight babies, that some of those drivers have to do with moms health before shes pregnant. Stephens says babies die in Baltimore not just because they were put to sleep someplace unsafe. Many die because theyre extremely small or born too early. Unmanaged diabetes or high blood pressure can contribute to those outcomes. And they can also seriously harm or kill a mother. Since, for a host of reasons, Black women are statistically likelier to have certain chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension than white women, having a baby is much more dangerous. Add to that, Black women sometimes face implicit bias in a doctors office or in the delivery room. That might mean theyre not believed when they tell doctors something is wrong. Theyre not treated the same as white women when they ask for pain medication. Racial disparities in health care can lead to tragedy. So Stephens says her team in the predominantly Black Upton/Druid Heights is determined not only to find pregnant women or women whove recently given birth to provide information about safe sleep. Theyre also working to find women before they get pregnant to make sure theyre as healthy as possible and get them the care they need. Catching health problems before they threaten lives Cathy Costa, with the Baltimore City Health Department, says one of those outreach efforts involves community-based health screening for hypertension for women of reproductive age. Shes been with Bmore for Healthy Babies since the start, and these days she analyzes infant and maternal mortality data for clues about what went wrong. She sees in the numbers what Stacey Stephens sees in the community, that as Baltimore battles for the lives of babies and mothers, it finds the fights are tougher to win for Black moms and babies. Catching and treating chronic diseases, which can be dangerous during pregnancy or childbirth for mom or baby, is essential. And community screening efforts are paying off. Theyre finding so much hypertension, says Costa, that theyre often finding women out in the community and sending them immediately to the emergency room, because women are not realizing that they have such high blood pressure that theyre in crisis. Costa says Bmore for Healthy Babies didnt start out with a goal to reduce maternal mortality. But over the past decade its become clear that saving mothers is the next frontier. What lies ahead: a focus on maternal health Still, as they head into the next decade, theres reason to celebrate. Bmore for Healthy Babies has helped cut infant mortality rates by nearly 40 percent.  Harvards Kennedy School and the Pew Charitable Trusts have recognized the work, and cities around the country are looking at adopting the model. CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield has given millions to support the effort to help make up for what federal dollars dont cover. Its the health plans biggest sustained community investment. The public private partnership has made a huge difference.

    "teaser": "Education and understanding are the first steps to addressing health inequities and disparities according to leading health organizations.",
    "article": "The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is driving change in healthcare by launching a national health equity strategy. Through this multi-faceted initiative, Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies will collaborate with community partners and organizations to reduce racial health disparities, address systemic racism and ultimately improve the health of all Americans. What are racial health inequities? According to the CDC, health inequities are reflected in differences in length of life; quality of life; rates of disease, disability, and death; severity of disease; and access to treatment. The COVID-19 health crisis continues to expose the racial inequities that have impacted generations of Americans. Researchers and public health advocates have known for decades that Americans from non-white, ethnic backgrounds experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, when compared to their white counterparts. The way to improve the lives of all Americans is to eliminate the barriers to good health which includes addressing systemic racism. CDC: Racism is a serious threat to the public's health Some facts on racial health inequities in America Black men are 70% more likely to die from a stroke as compared to non-Hispanic white men. Millennials from majority Black and Hispanic communities have lower diagnosis rates of major depression, 31% and 55% lower respectively when compared to white communities. Black adults are 60% more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to be diagnosed with diabetes by a physician. Black mothers have 3x higher maternal mortality and 2x higher morbidity than white mothers What is health equity? Health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to “attain his or her full health potential” and no one is “disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health Equity Leaders: Meet the BCBSA national advisory panel of doctors, public health experts and community leaders A new strategy to achieve health equity The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) launched a national health equity strategy to address these types of inequities with a multi-faceted, long term approach. The multi-year strategy will focus on four conditions that disproportionately affect communities of color: maternal health, behavioral health, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. As a first step, BCBSA announced it would set a goal of reducing racial health disparities in maternal health by 50 percent in five years. Here's how BCBSA will support national health equity goals: Improving data collection Scaling effective programs Addressing bias Building partnerships Influencing policy decisions The crisis in racial disparities in our country’s health care is unconscionable and unacceptable. Our deep roots in the local communities we serve, combined with the scale and scope of our national reach, enable all of us at Blue Cross Blue Shield companies to drive this new strategy and bring real change. Kim Keck, President and CEO Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Blue Cross Blue Shield Association confronts nation's crisis on racial health disparities Working together for a common goal Leading health organizations are currently working to eliminate health disparities through education. The Office of Minority Health offers programs on cultural and linguistic competency through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. Training serves to bring about positive health outcomes for the nation's rapidly growing percentage of Americans with non-white racial and ethnic backgrounds.
