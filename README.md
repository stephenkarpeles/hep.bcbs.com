[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/BCBSADigital/hep.bcbs.com/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BCBSADigital/hep.bcbs.com/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/BCBSADigital/hep.bcbs.com/actions) for its
CI/CD pipeline. The main workflow builds Gatsby and, for specific cases, deploys the output to AWS S3 buckets. This workflow is triggered by pushing any branch, a semantic tag, or by the GitHub API's
[`workflow_dispatch`][workflow] and [`repository_dispatch`][repo] events.

The steps of the workflow are:

1. Build Gatsby, retaining its cache between workflow runs
2. Archive the Gatsby output
3. Sync the archive contents to an AWS S3 bucket
4. Clear the AWS Cloudfront cache for the static site

Steps 3-4 will only run for the `dev`, `uat`, `stage`, and `master` branches or any tagged releases.
The `master` branch would normally be excluded, but this workflow can be triggered by the GitHub API's
[`workflow_dispatch`][workflow] and [`repository_dispatch`][repo] events, which use the repository's
default branch.
