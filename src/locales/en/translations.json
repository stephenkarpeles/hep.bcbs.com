Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) companies have been committed to advancing health equity in our communities for decades, and there is more work to be done. Our National Health Equity Strategy will tackle the crisis by setting unifying goals and standardizing national measures in critical areas. We will not do this work alone. We have an advisory panel of doctors, public health experts and community leaders to counsel us along the way. When we bring more people to the table, we can help create lasting change.",
