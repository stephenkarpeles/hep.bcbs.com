          Dr. Marshall H. Chin, a practicing general internist and health
          services researcher, has dedicated his career to reducing health
          disparities through interventions at individual, organizational,
          community and policy levels.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Chin has elucidated practical approaches to improving care of
          diverse individual patients and addressing systemic, structural
          drivers of disparities in the health care system. Through the Robert
          Wood Johnson Foundation Advancing Health Equity program, Dr. Chin
          collaborates with teams of state Medicaid agencies, Medicaid managed
          care organizations and frontline healthcare organizations to implement
          payment reforms to support and incentivize care transformations that
          advance health equity. He also partners with eight urban and rural
          communities to integrate medical and social care to reduce diabetes
          disparities through the Merck Foundation Bridging the Gap program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chin evaluates the value of the federally qualified health center
          program, improves diabetes outcomes in Chicago’s South Side through
          healthcare and community interventions, and improves shared decision
          making among clinicians and LGBTQ persons of color. He also applies
          ethical principles to reforms to reduce health disparities,
          discussions about a culture of equity, and what it means for health
          professionals to care and advocate for their patients. Dr. Chin’s most
          recent project uses improv and standup comedy, storytelling and
          theater to improve training of students in caring for diverse patients
          and engaging in constructive discussions around systemic racism and
          social privilege. Dr. Chin and his team created the Roadmap to Reduce
          Disparities cited in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
          reports. Dr. Chin is a member of the National Advisory Council of the
          National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. He is a
          former President of the Society of General Internal Medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chin is a graduate of Harvard College and the University of
          California at San Francisco School of Medicine, and he completed
          residency and fellowship training in general internal medicine at
          Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. He has received
          mentoring awards from the Society of General Internal Medicine and
          University of Chicago. He was elected to the National Academy of
          Medicine in 2017, and recently served on NAM’s Committee on the Future
          of Nursing 2020-2030.

          Dr. Hardeman leverages the frameworks of critical race theory and
          reproductive justice to inform her equity-centered work which aims to
          build the empirical evidence of racism’s impact on health,
          particularly for Black birthing people and their babies. In 2020, she
          was named the first Blue Cross Endowed Professor of Health and Racial
          Equity.

          Birth Center, in North Minneapolis, one of five Black-owned

          Published in journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine and

          elicited important conversations on the topics of culturally-centered
          care, police brutality and structural racism as a fundamental cause of
          health inequities. Her overarching goal is to contribute to a body of
          knowledge that links structural racism to health in a tangible way,
          identifies opportunities for intervention, and dismantles the systems,
          structures and institutions that allow inequities to persist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Hardeman is active locally and nationally with organizations that

          Minnesota Maternal Mortality Review Committee and the CDC Maternal
          Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA) Bias work group where

          A 43-year YMCA professional, Kevin Washington is the 14th person and
          first African American to lead the Y in the United States.
        </h3>
        <p>
          He came to YMCA of the USA in February 2015 from the YMCA of Greater
          Boston, where he was President and CEO from 2010 to 2014. He expanded
          membership and access by reducing rates, increased diversity and
          engagement among the Board of Directors to better reflect the
          community and implemented a childhood-education quality initiative
          that benefits thousands of children and families throughout eastern
          Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to Boston, Washington served as President and CEO of the YMCA of
          Greater Hartford from 2000 to 2010. Under his leadership the Hartford
          YMCA invested more than $60 million to develop or expand eight
          facilities and camps. He was Chief Operating Officer for the YMCA of
          Metropolitan Chicago from 1995 to 2000, and he previously held other
          executive roles with the Chicago YMCA and the Philadelphia Freedom
          Valley YMCA. He got his start in the Y as Youth Program Director at
          the Philadelphia YMCA's Christian Street branch in 1978.

          The YMCA (the Y) is a worldwide youth organization based in Geneva,
          Switzerland, with more than 64 million beneficiaries in 120 countries.
          It was founded on June 6, 1844 by Sir George Williams in London. YMCAs
          are strongly rooted in their communities and offer a variety of
          programs and services based on local priorities and issues affecting
          young people and their communities. The YMCA is a non-governmental
          federation, with each independent local YMCA affiliated with its
          national organization. Each national organization, in turn, is part of
          both an Area Alliance, based on geographic location, and the World
          Alliance of YMCAs.
