                In the U.S., Black women face significant disparities in their
                health, driven largely by systemic racism and discrimination.

                To transform the maternal care experience for Black women and
                their babies, Blue Shield of California is reimagining the
                prenatal and postpartum care experience. The health plan is
                piloting solutions that address community advocacy, improved
                access to medical, behavioral, mental and social care, provide
                culturally competent support systems and improve quality of
                care. Solutions may include tapping into community-based
                experts, for example trauma-informed doulas, to champion the
                needs of Black mothers and infants, including increasing access
                to critical maternal care services, increasing their maternal
                quality of care and addressing maternal behavioral health.
