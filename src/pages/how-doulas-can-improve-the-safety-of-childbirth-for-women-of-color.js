                For every mother who dies a pregnancy-related death in the U.S.,
                70 experience a life threatening event. These are unexpected
                cases of what doctors call severe maternal morbidity (SMM)
                events such as cardiac arrest, hemorrhage or sepsis, events that
                could have been fatal or can affect a woman long after
                childbirth. The overall rate of these events{" "}

                in the past two decades. And the statistics are worse for Black,
                Indigenous and other women of color (BIPOC). Researchers at the

                  Black women face a 70% higher risk of SMM than any other
                  racial group

                to have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth.
              </p>
              <h4>The role of doulas in reducing SMM</h4>
              <p>
                Doulas provide emotional, physical, and informational support to
                women before, during and after childbirth. They’re trained but
                non-clinical partners to women, often supplementing care from
                doctors and midwives. There’s evidence to suggest that working
                with a doula can reduce serious complications among BIPOC women.
                Research finds that doula care can help reduce c-sections,
                decrease maternal anxiety and depression and help coordinate
                care and communication between BIPOC women and their other
                healthcare providers.{" "}

                , “The role of doula care in reducing c-sections is important,

                Many BCBS companies are including doula coverage in their

                    School to create and train a network of eight community
                    doulas to assist women at risk of poor birth outcomes. Blue

                Doulas may also be able to play another role in eliminating
                racial disparities in maternal health. A Tufts University School

                that doulas may be more trusted members of the community and
                able to spend time listening to a mother's needs and concerns.
                Within the traditional healthcare system, Black women face
                unconscious bias, which can cause doctors to dismiss a Black
                mother's concerns or create a lack of trust between patient and
                doctor.
