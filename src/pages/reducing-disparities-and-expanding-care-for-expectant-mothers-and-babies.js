                are worse for women of color. These disparities are leading to
                worsening health outcomes for pregnant and post-partum women,

                In an effort to help improve these statistics, BCBSIL is
                supporting parents in Chicago’s South and West Side
                neighborhoods by providing funding to community-based
                organizations working to improve maternal health outcomes. The
                organizations utilize doulas, midwives and telemedicine to
                provide education, labor care, breastfeeding help and postpartum
                support within a culturally appropriate lens.
              </p>
              <p>
                BCBSIL is also teaming up with Centering Healthcare Institute, a
                non-profit focused on delivering better health outcomes and
                improving the care experience for patients and their doctors.
                Through a three-year grant, BCBSIL will be bringing CHI’s
                CenteringPregnancy program to a number of Federally Qualified
                Health Centers (FQHCs) that focus on serving underserved and
                at-risk populations.
