                Doula care is available for Medicaid members in several of
                Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield (Anthem BCBS) markets based on
                benefits and eligibility. When possible, pregnant mothers of
                color are matched with doulas of color to provide culturally
                sensitive care.

                of Baby and Me® are comprehensive care management programs
                focused on improving prenatal health and birth outcomes for
                pregnant Medicaid members:
