                Since 1997, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBS VT) has
                been supporting new and expectant mothers with its Better
                Beginnings program. Today, it is one of the most comprehensive
                maternal care management programs in the country, with a focus
                on maternal and child health, social connection and
                culturally-informed care. Better Beginnings boasts a nearly 70%
                engagement rate among BCBS VTâ€™s expectant members. Participants
                benefit from wraparound support both before and after delivery.
                Enrollment begins with a comprehensive health risk assessment
                that includes mental and behavioral health factors, medical
                considerations, social connection, and language, cultural and
                religious considerations. From there, members are paired with a
                nurse case manager who can support their unique needs through
                pregnancy and beyond. Postpartum, new mothers are screened for
                depression and are encouraged to access lactation consultants to
                support mothers through the challenges they may experience with
                nursing.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield National Health Equity
                commitment, BCBS VT is exploring ways to reach those mothers who
                are most in need of support.
