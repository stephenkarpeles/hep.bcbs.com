                  Healthy Blue Beginnings
                </a>{" "}
                is BCBSLA’s care management program for high - risk pregnancies.
                This program offers pregnant women personalized information and
                confidential support from experienced nurses t hroughout their
                pregnancy. In addition to referrals from individual physicians,
                BCBSLA receives referrals to Healthy Blue Beginnings from its
                relationship with Louisiana Women’s Healthcare Associates
                (LWHA), the largest OB/GYN physician group in the state of
                Louisiana. Obstetricians at LWHA refer patients to Healthy Blue
                Beginnings if they have one or more of a list of conditions that
                includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>History of preterm labor</li>
                <li>Diabetes</li>
                <li>Hypertension</li>
                <li>Obesity</li>
                <li>History of smoking</li>
                <li>Substance use disorder</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In the 2020s, data is now an important healthcare partner, and
                data plays a part with high - risk pregnancy referrals, too.
                Recently, Blue Cross began receiving Admit, Discharge, Transfer
                (ADT) data from any healthcare provider that uses an electronic
                medical records sys tem and has a capability to feed the insurer
                their data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another pregnancy support program is a unique texting service
                called{" "}
                <a href="https://www.text4baby.org/" target="_blank">

                . Whether or not a woman joins Healthy Blue Beginnings, BCBSLA
                encourages her to join text4baby. Moms get free text messages
                with health and safety tips for their pregnancy and baby’s first
                year. The messages are tailored based on due date or baby’s
                birth date. Just text the word BABY (BEBE for Spanish tips) to
                511411 on your cellphone.

                markets. Blue Cross and its employees also donate their time and
                money to organizations like March of Dimes, which works to
                prevent birth defects.
