                The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation supported a
                doula support integration and coordination of care for high risk
                women in labor through a partnership with Western Michigan
                University Homer Stryker Medical School.  The program will
                create and train a network of eight community doulas to assist
                the most at risk women (low socioeconomic status, women of
                color, or prior poor birth outcome), who lack support during
                labor and postpartum, and provide coordination between doulas
                and community health workers for transition of care from
                hospital to home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, Labor and Delivery staff will be trained on the
                outcome benefits for having doulas; identify high-risk women for
                doula services through local prenatal clinics services and at
                delivery. Doulas will assist women during delivery, visit
                patient at home (first week), following covid-19 protection
                protocols and then will connect the women with a community
                health worker for post-natal/early infancy home visitation
                follow-up.

                The Obstetrics Initiative (OBI) is a state-wide, data-driven
                quality improvement project supported by Blue Cross Blue Shield
                of Michigan (BCBSMI)/Blue Care Network to create optimal
                maternity care experiences for Michigan families.

                The first initiative is supporting vaginal birth and safely
                lowering the cesarean delivery rate among low-risk patients.

              <p>
                OBI is working to identify and address variation in obstetric
                driven care in the state of Michigan through collaboration,
                rapid cycle data reporting, and quality improvement initiatives.
                The first initiative is supporting vaginal birth and safely
                lowering the cesarean delivery rate among low-risk patients. OBI
                promotes collaboration and the sharing of best practices among
                participating maternity hospitals. By collecting data, analyzing
                data, and reporting data back to OBI participants, opportunities
                for improvement can be identified and quality improvement
                initiatives can be implemented.
