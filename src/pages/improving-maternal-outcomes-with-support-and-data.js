                Home visiting for pregnant mothers is an evidence-based practice shown to help women have healthier, safer pregnancies. For women of color, who are likely to die from pregnancy-related causes or experience pregnancy complications, a home visiting program can help address some of the risk factors, including support in managing chronic conditions like hypertension or diabetes. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York and Highmark Blue Shield of Northeastern New York have created a high-risk maternity home visiting case management program, partnering with local agencies to deliver services in a mother’s home. Home visitors can also address social determinants of health that might affect a woman’s pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum health, including housing and transportation issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Members receiving home visits can work one on one, in person when safe, with specialty-trained nurses who provide individualized education and help coordinate care throughout a mother’s pregnancy and for six months after delivery. Nurses also follow up with a mother’s clinicians about her status and facilitate specialty services or referrals.
