                Home visiting for pregnant mothers is an evidence-based practice
                shown to help women have healthier, safer pregnancies. For women
                of color, who are likely to die from pregnancy-related causes or
                experience pregnancy complications, a home visiting program can
                help address some of the risk factors, including support in
                managing chronic conditions like hypertension or diabetes.
                Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York and Highmark
                Blue Shield of Northeastern New York have created a high-risk
                maternity home visiting case management program, partnering with
                local agencies to deliver services in a mother’s home. Home
                visitors can also address social determinants of health that
                might affect a woman’s pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum
                health, including housing and transportation issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Members receiving home visits can work one on one, in person
                when safe, with specialty-trained nurses who provide
                individualized education and help coordinate care throughout a
                mother’s pregnancy and for six months after delivery. Nurses
                also follow up with a mother’s clinicians about her status and
                facilitate specialty services or referrals.
