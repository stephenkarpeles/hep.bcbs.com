                The U.S. is among the most dangerous developed nations for
                pregnant women, new moms and babies, according to data from the
                March of Dimes. Outcomes are especially concerning for women of
                color: maternal mortality rates among Black women, for example,
                are three times higher than those among white women. While these
                disparities are caused by a complex fabric of social, political
                and economic injustices, implicit bias in the healthcare system
                plays a well-documented role.
              </p>
              <p>
                To support healthcare workers in identifying and addressing
                their own implicit biases,{" "}
                <strong>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina</strong>{" "}
                (Blue Cross NC) helped March of Dimes launch its national
                Breaking Through Bias in Maternity Care program in North
                Carolina, which was converted to a virtual experience due to the
                COVID-19 pandemic. Maternal care providers across North Carolina
                pay no fee to attend. The programâ€™s curriculum covers structural
                racism in the U.S., strategies to mitigate bias in maternity
                care and approaches to building a culture of equity in
                workplaces and communities.
