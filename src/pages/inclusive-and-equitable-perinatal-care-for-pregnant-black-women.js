                The rate of pregnancy-related deaths is nearly three times
                higher for Black women in Maryland than it is for White women,
                according to the Maryland Department of Health’s annual maternal
                mortality review. Across the country, that number is not
                improving, but in Baltimore, home to the largest health plan,
                that racial disparity is narrowing.
              </p>
              <p>
                CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, through their grantmaking
                efforts, has invested in a decade-long Baltimore City
                initiative, B’more for Healthy Babies, which has reduced infant
                deaths by more than 30%.
              </p>
              <p>
                Grantmaking efforts also support Mamatoto Village, an
                organization that makes perinatal support services more
                accessible and provides pathways to careers in maternal health
                for Black women. Services for pregnant Black women include home
                visits, community birth workers who attend to their emotional,
                educational and physical needs and lactation consultants.
                Mamatoto Village emphasizes inclusive, respectful and equitable
                care, and empowers women and communities to adopt healthy
                lifestyles.
