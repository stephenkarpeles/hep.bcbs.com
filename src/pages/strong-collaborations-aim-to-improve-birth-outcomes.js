                BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina (BlueCross SC) is
                improving maternal care as a leading partner of the Birth
                Outcomes Initiative (BOI). The program is a partnership
                between the South Carolina Department of Health and Human
                Services (SCDHHS), The South Carolina Hospital Association
                (SCHA), March of Dimes, BlueCross SC and more than 100 other
                stakeholders to improve health outcomes for newborns in the
                Medicaid program and throughout the state. The goal is to unite
                private and public organizations to lower preterm birth, the
                leading cause of infant death in the state, through pledges from
                hospitals to end non-medically indicated elective inductions,
                public and private alignment on a non-payment policy and
                outreach to at-risk mothers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Launched in 2011, the BOI has three interconnected goals that
                work together to improve birth outcomes throughout the state,
                including:
              </p>
              <ul className="pp-content__fancy-list">
                <li>
                  <p>Reducing the number of low birth weight babies </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reducing NICU admissions and stays</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reducing racial disparities in birth outcomes</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                An early effort of the South Carolina BOI was to end elective
                inductions for non-medically indicated deliveries prior to 39
                weeks and make resources available to at-risk mothers. The State
                of South Carolina used its multi-stakeholder BOI to reduce
                early-term, elective inductions by 50 percent, improving birth
                outcomes while saving the state and the federal government $6
                million in Medicaid spending for the first quarter of fiscal
                year 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                How it works: Partnered with leaders from key clinical
                organizations and gained agreement from all birthing hospitals
                to stop early elective deliveries. - Implemented a policy of
                non-payment for early elective deliveries without medical
                necessity, a private and public (Medicaid) solution. - Leveraged
                member maternity programs and the Centering Pregnancy model of
                care.
              </p>
              <p>
                The BOI contains a number of components, including a policy
                adopted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Human
                Services (DHHS) and BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina
                (BlueCross SC), the state’s largest commercial insurer, to stop
                paying for early elective deliveries (elective inductions and
                cesarean deliveries prior to 39 weeks gestation). South Carolina
                was the first state in the nation where both public (Medicaid)
                and private (BlueCross SC) entities implemented the same
                non-payment policy for early elective deliveries for both
                hospitals and physicians. BlueCross SC conducted extensive
                outreach to its large employer customers so the policy change
                would not be a surprise.
