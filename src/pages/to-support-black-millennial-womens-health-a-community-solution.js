                Drawing on the city's rich culture of creativity and community,
                the challenge invited everyday innovators to submit their best
                ideas to improve millennials' health.
              </p>
              <p>
                The launch of the challenge held a special significance in the
                midst of the coronavirus pandemic, a time of extraordinary
                uncertainty which has exacerbated mental health crises,
                addictions, economic disruptions and health disparities. In
                light of these unique challenges, the competition sought
                solutions across three themes: Mind/Body, Food and Nutrition,
                and Community/Social Connection.

                women," said Hey, Auntie! founder, Nicole Kennedy. "In the next
                five years, my goal is to use the data we gathered through Hey,

                The Well City Challenge initially received more than 100
                applications representing all five counties and 51 zip codes in
                Southeastern Pennsylvania. Out of that initial set of
                applications, 15 teams were chosen to participate in a pitch
                competition in March. Five finalists emerged from the pitch
                competition and then participated in an “impact accelerator”
                this spring. The accelerator allowed the finalists to test their
                ideas and receive resources around market validation, business
                planning, communications, and funder engagement.

                will support Kennnedy with a $50,000 grant to help her implement

                    Independence joined America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP)
                    and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in a pledge to
                    promote vaccinations for 2 million underserved, at-risk
                    Americans. As part of this work, they supported efforts to
                    vaccinate the region's most underserved, under-vaccinated
                    populations and worked with community groups to ensure
                    equitable access to vaccines for Black and Brown residents.
