            <p>
              One year ago, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association set a bold
              goal to reduce racial disparities in maternal health by 50% in
              five years. Over the last 12 months, we uncovered key insights to
              inform our work ahead and drive similar action throughout the
              maternal health ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Racial disparities in maternal health span education levels,
              socioeconomic status, age and geography—pointing to deeper-seated
              issues like underlying chronic conditions, racial inequities and
              bias within the health care system that must be addressed
              systemically and across a woman’s life span—not just while she is
              pregnant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meaningful actions must combat the cultural, operational and
              structural barriers that have created inequities that exist today,
              while also addressing disparities in maternal health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guided by the actions underway by BCBS companies, we identified 10
              tangible steps organizations can adopt to improve maternal health
              and make a measurable difference in health disparities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We alone cannot measurably impact the health inequities women of
              color face today. And if the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s
              that we cannot solve system-wide problems in a vacuum—particularly
              when lives are at stake.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re calling upon leaders in the public and private sectors to
              adopt these 10 actions, and join BCBS companies as we work toward
              a shared vision of safer, equitable care for all mothers.
