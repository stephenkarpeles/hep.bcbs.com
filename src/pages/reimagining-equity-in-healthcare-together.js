                Health disparities are the result of a complex fabric of social,
                racial and economic injustice—a fabric we can’t unravel
                overnight. But starting here and now, the Blues are taking
                immediate and ongoing action to put an end to these inequities,
                setting bold goals and holding ourselves accountable to tangible
                results.

                  in the next five years, we will reduce racial disparities in

                Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells
                us that women of color—specifically Black and Indigenous
                women—are three times more likely to die from pregnancy
                complications than their white counterparts. In fact,{" "}

                Many BCBS companies have started this work and are already
                focused on preventing these dangerous outcomes. Their work to

                    to manage their chronic conditions during pregnancy.

                To address racial health disparities in a meaningful way, we

                    efforts like the CDC’s recently announced initiatives to
                    address racism as a public health threat, the White House’s
                    first-ever proclamation on Black maternal health and the

                employers and other stakeholders—to join us in this crucial
                work. Together, I believe we can build a new model of equitable
